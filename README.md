# Introduction

Simple image generation tool with NodeJS + TypeScript + HTMX + Marko + OpenAI API

# How to run

1. If you encounter any issues missing packages, try install via `npm install -g <package-name>` as there are some global dependencies to compile the code.
2. Create a file called `.env`, put in the contents from `.env.example`, and replace with your OpenAPI API key and organization ID.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
